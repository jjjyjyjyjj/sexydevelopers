For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle. 
If you do not have any such features, you can either:

(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or
(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Principle 1: Equitable Use
→ Our program adheres to this as the program does not outrightly discriminate against anyone’s identity / disability. It’ll run regardless of who the user is.

Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
→ Our application will need to make moderate improvements in flexibility to better accommodate diverse user needs, particularly those with strict dietary preferences, whose requirements are not yet fully addressed.

 Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use 
→ The labels on the buttons on the application are direct and simple. Hence, users are able to use the application with ease and without much confusion.

Principle 4: Perceptible Information 
→ The visual elements in our application are well contrasted with the others and ensure a well-legible user experience. However, we could implement auditory assistance for users with visual impairments for future improvements.

Principle 5: Tolerance for Error 
→ We have a remove button for users to remove recipes from their favourite recipes if they added a recipe to their favourites on accident. The same goes for adding and removing ingredients from their fridge.

Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
→ This principle emphasizes minimising physical strain and effort. It does not apply to our application since we are a virtual application, which mainly deals with cognitive and digital interactions instead. So, users only need to do minimal physical effort like typing or pressing buttons.

 Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
→ This principle focuses on ensuring a design accommodates to physical sizes, postures and movements, thus allowing for more comfortable and effective use. Similar to principle 6, this principle is not relevant to our program for the same reasons. There aren’t any significant physical barriers to overcome.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

 Our program is marketed towards students and anyone who needs inspiration with what to cook for their meals or how to use ingredients they’ve gotten. Since our algorithm provides randomised recipes, the user would be able to try out new cuisines and dishes that aren’t in their repertoire. After they’ve tried the recipes provided, the users are able to access and remake the recipes again since they’re saved.

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

Our application is primarily designed to meet the needs of younger adults, which may make it less useful or intuitive for older adults, the elderly, or younger demographics. This could inadvertently exclude these groups, potentially causing tangible harm. Additionally, the app is not well-suited for users with strict dietary restrictions, as the recommended recipes lack information on caloric content and potential allergens. This oversight may impact relational equality, making these users feel undervalued or excluded from the application's functionality. Recognizing these limitations provides a clear direction for future improvements, aiming to address the needs of a broader demographic and enhance inclusivity.
