### An Overview of the Software
PantryPal is a software that recommends recipes based on the ingredients users' have. 

After creating an account with us, the user is able to add ingredients into a virtual fridge, which the software
utilises to generate recipe recommendations. If a user is not interested in the recipe recommended, they have an option 
to skip said recipe and the software will recommend a new recipe.

### Features of the Software
* _Up-to-date Fridge_
    At a click of a button, the user can easily add new ingredients to the fridge. Additionally, after indicating that 
    they've tried a recipe, the quantity of ingredients used will automatically be removed/ decreased from their fridge.

* _Tried Recipes History_
    The user can access a record of recipes that they've tried previously.

* _Ability to Favourite a Recipe_
    If the user really likes a recipe they've tried, they have the option to favourite it and access it later on. The 
    user can also remove a recipe from their favourited in the event they misclicked. 

* _Option to Save a Recipe for Later_
    If the user is interested in a recipe recommended but may not be in the mood for it currently, they can save it and
    access it later on.
