### An Overview of the Software
#### _**Have ingredients in your fridge that you're not quite sure how to use? PantryPal is here to solve that issue for you!**_
PantryPal is a software that recommends recipes based on the ingredients users' have.

After creating an account with us, you will be able to add ingredients into a virtual fridge, which the software
utilises to generate recipe recommendations. If you are not interested in the first recipe recommended, you choose to
skip said recipe and the software will recommend a new recipe.

### Features of the Software
* _Up-to-date Fridge_
    At a click of a button, you can easily add new ingredients to the fridge. Additionally, after indicating that 
    you've tried a recipe, the quantity of ingredients used will automatically be removed or decreased from the fridge.

* _Tried Recipes History_
    You can access a record of recipes that you've tried previously.

* _Ability to Favourite a Recipe_
    If you really like a recipe you've tried previously, you have the option to favourite it and access it later on. You
    can also remove a recipe from their favourited in the event that you misclicked. 

* _Save a Recipe for Later_
    If you're interested in a recommended recipe but may not be in the mood for it currently, you can save it and
    access it later on.
