// Responsibility: take the Input Data and execute
//the use case, looking up information in the Data
//Access object when necessary and manipulating
//Entities. This might create new data that needs
//to be saved in the Data Access layer.
//When complete, create an Output Data object —
//the use case result — and pass it to the
//Presenter.

//Responsibility: when the View Model is
//updated the View is alerted through a
//callback. The View then displays the new
//information to the user, possibly activating
//another View
